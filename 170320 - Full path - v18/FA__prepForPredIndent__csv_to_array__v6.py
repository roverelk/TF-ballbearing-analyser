# 24.01.17  ekk     Comment     Deler opp programmet s책 det er mulig 책 se p책 hver enkelt del.
# 30.01.17  ekk     Cleaned     Koden tar n책 bare inn ett sett med .csv
# 08.02.17  ekk     Multiple    Re-arranging so it will use multiple input at the same time again. So to train the model
#                               with multiple inputs at once. So not to climatize to a single input at a time.
# 08.02.17  ekk     Shuffle     This program now shuffles the output arrays in unison so the corresponding x- and y-
#                               values have the same position in their respective arrays.
# 15.02.17  ekk     Repurposed  Repurposed the heavier prepreation file for training a model into a simple one for
#                               preparing dataset to be predicted the type.
# 15.02.17  ekk     Coppied     Made a copy for the purpose of preparing the "prediction indent"-process.
